# Ideas

Game is about **solving problems.**

Solving problems gets you **Knowledge,** our analog of money that is the universal currency.

Problems also give you Specific Knowledge on each category of math:
* Algebra
* Analysis
* Statistics
* Geometry
* Number Theory
* Topology
* Set Theory
* Class Theory
etc.

## Core Loop

You get **Knowledge** when you solve problems. Each problem solved adds to a "family" of solutions, which get expanded.

## Ramblings

At some point, you might find an infinite family of solutions for a particular class of problems.

The stages of the game are: finite solutions, countably infinite families and uncountably infinite families.

The bank of solutions you build over the course of the game makes a "history" tree, where you start unlocking new theorems.

It would be **really** cool if the game was about "running through history's famous problems and math field introductions" and building up theorems.

And then you **prestige** yourself backwards in time but keeping some theorems, and, thus, solving multiple branches of the history tree faster and faster.

I imagine a **HUGE** graph where the edges are problems and nodes are theorems you build up to. You have multiple ways to unlock the same theorem (like there are multiple ways to prove Pythagoras' Theorem), and thus you can "solve" the problems you like the most to get there, engaging in whichever minigame you prefer.

When you unlock a theorem, it might trivialize some games (there is another graph that maps theorems to problems, sorta like a dual graph), which, in turn, lets you have infinite amount of that type of currency (e.g. countably infinite geometry points because you have some sort of advanced theorem) and thus only need to complete the other problems to unlock more and more theorems and so on.

Maybe the game is about live resource management. You have limited neurons you can put into resolving each set of problems. A **problem** is a set of problems, so you need to use your resources to solve each of the building parts of the singular bigger problem. **This is where the "incremental" part will come in, since a single part of a bigger problem might be a hard problem in-and-of itself.**
