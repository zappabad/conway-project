# Progression on Conway Project

Most games give points based on:

$$ (Speed \ \ \times \ \ Base \ Difficuty)^{Efficiency}$$

and can be enhanced with upgrades such as **+10 Speed** or **times two Base Difficulty** or **more efficiency modifiers**

Since this is the thing for most games, we will simply omit them and instead focus on key upgrades.

## Geometry

### Making Shapes

Making geometrical forms with compass and straightedges

Has the functionality to add points by clicking on existing structures or empty space (Ctrl click deletes points), Shift controls Compass, otherwise control straightedge.

Each shape made gives you **Geometry points based on speed used to make times base difficulty of the form made, all that to the power of efficiency modifiers.**

#### Upgrades

    Hinting next steps

    Decreasing shape complexity

    Remembering simple forms like an equilateral triangle so you can click them to make new shapes.

    Learning to multiply a shape's size (finding proportional shapes)



#### Bosses

Geometry bosses are **complicated drawings.**
